## Description

_This application determines the age of the user and also returns their age in years based on other planets solar year length. It will then take those returned ages and tell them how much longer they are expected to live or how much they surpassed the expected age._

## Specs
* _First, the users age will be converted to what their age would be on other planets._
  * _For example: If the user is 20 on Earth, then that means they would be 4 on Mercury, 12.4 on Venus, 37.6 on Mars, and 237 on Jupiter._
* _After that, the users estimated time left to live will be calculated._
  * _For example: If the user is 20 they will have about 60 years left to live._
* _Finally, if the user has surpassed their life expectancy then the time they have surpassed their expectancy will be returned._
  * _For example: If the user is 90 they will have surpassed their life expectancy by about 10 years._
